            <h1>Venus: Earth's Mysterious Twin</h1>

            <p>
                Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s twin due to its similar size and
                structure.
                However, it is one of the most inhospitable places in our solar system. The surface temperature of Venus
                exceeds 460°C (860°F), making it the hottest planet — even hotter than Mercury.
            </p>

            <p>
                Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. The
                atmospheric
                pressure on Venus is about 92 times that of Earth’s at sea level. These conditions create a runaway
                greenhouse
                effect, trapping heat and making it nearly impossible for life as we know it to exist.
            </p>

            Distance from the Sun: ~108.2 million km (67.24 million miles)

            Orbital Period: 225 Earth days

            Diameter: 12,104 km (about 95% of Earth’s)

            Mass: 4.867 × 10²⁴ kg (about 81.5% of Earth’s)

            Gravity: 8.87 m/s² (about 90% of Earth’s gravity)

            Moons: None

            Rotation: Retrograde (rotates backward); 1 Venus day = 243 Earth days

            Atmosphere: 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, with clouds of sulfuric acid

            Average Surface Temperature: ~465°C (869°F) — hotter than Mercury!


            <p>
                Venus formed around 4.6 billion years ago along with the rest of the solar system. Like Earth, it grew
                from planetesimals that collided and fused in the solar nebula. However, for reasons not fully
                understood, Venus took a dramatically different evolutionary path.

                Scientists believe that Venus may once have had liquid water and habitable conditions, but a runaway
                greenhouse effect caused by excess CO₂ turned it into the hellish world it is today.
            </p>

            <p>
                New missions like NASA’s VERITAS and Europe’s EnVision are planned to map Venus’s surface and understand
                its geological history. These will help answer whether Venus ever had oceans and what made it so
                different
                from Earth despite their similarities.
            </p>

            <p>

                Venus is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a solid surface hidden beneath thick clouds. Some key features
                include:

                Maxwell Montes – The highest mountain on Venus, ~11 km tall (taller than Mount Everest)

                Volcanoes – Thousands of them, including Maat Mons, possibly still active

                Tesserae – Complex, ridged terrain possibly formed by tectonic activity

                Craters – Fewer than expected, suggesting a relatively young surface (~300–600 million years old)

                The planet’s surface appears to have been completely resurfaced by volcanic activity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite its harsh environment, Venus has been explored by several missions:

                Venera Program (USSR): First to land on Venus (Venera 7 in 1970); captured surface images

                Magellan (NASA, 1989): Mapped 98% of the surface with radar

                Akatsuki (Japan, 2015): Still studying Venus's weather

                Parker Solar Probe & BepiColombo: Performed gravity assists and collected data
