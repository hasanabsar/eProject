            <h1>Neptune: The Mysterious Ice Giant of the Outer Solar System"</h1>

            <p>
                Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a mysterious and distant world that continues
                to intrigue scientists and space enthusiasts alike. As an ice giant, Neptune is composed primarily of
                substances like water, ammonia, and methane, making it different from the gas giants like Jupiter and
                Saturn. With its stunning blue hue, powerful storms, and mysterious features, Neptune remains a planet
                of fascination. Let’s dive into the details and uncover the secrets of this enigmatic planet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Basic Facts About Neptune
                Type: Ice Giant

                Diameter: 49,244 km (about 4 times the diameter of Earth)

                Mass: 17 times the mass of Earth

                Orbital Period: 164.8 Earth years (Neptune takes nearly 165 years to orbit the Sun)

                Day Length: Approximately 16 hours

                Moons: 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest

                Temperature: -214°C (-353°F) on average, making it one of the coldest planets in the solar system.

                Neptune is often referred to as the "King of the Outer Solar System" due to its dominant position at the
                outermost reaches of the solar system. Despite its distance from the Sun, Neptune is still a dynamic and
                active planet, with winds, storms, and an active atmosphere that scientists continue to study.


            </p>

            <p>
                Distance from the Sun
                Neptune resides 4.5 billion kilometers (about 30 AU) from the Sun, making it the most distant of the
                eight official planets in our solar system. Because of its vast distance from the Sun, Neptune is very
                cold, and its surface is dimly lit by sunlight that is only about 1/900th of the brightness that Earth
                receives.

                Orbital Period: Due to its distant orbit, Neptune takes approximately 164.8 Earth years to complete one
                full revolution around the Sun. This means that Neptune’s seasons last for about 40 Earth years, making
                them much longer than those on Earth.
            </p>

            <p>
                eptune’s Atmosphere and Composition
                Neptune is an ice giant, which means its composition is quite different from the gas giants like Jupiter
                and Saturn. It has a thick atmosphere that consists primarily of hydrogen (80%), helium (19%), and a
                significant amount of methane (around 1-2%). It is believed that Neptune's atmosphere also contains
                water, ammonia, and other volatile substances, which contribute to the planet’s unique features.
            </p>

            <p>
                Temperature:
                Neptune is one of the coldest planets in the solar system, with an average temperature of about -214°C
                (-353°F). Despite its chilly temperature, Neptune radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun. This
                is due to its internal heat, likely from the planet's slow contraction and possibly some internal
                processes that generate energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wind Speeds:
                Neptune is known for its incredibly high wind speeds, which can reach up to 2,100 km/h (about 1,300
                mph). These winds are the fastest recorded in the solar system, and they play a significant role in the
                planet’s active and dynamic atmosphere.
