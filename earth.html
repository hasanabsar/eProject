            <h1>Earth: Our Unique and Dynamic Home</h1>

            <p>
                Earth is the only known planet in the universe that harbors life. Positioned as the third planet from
                the Sun, Earth is a vibrant, dynamic world where geology, climate, and biology interact in complex and
                beautiful ways. From towering mountains and deep oceans to lush forests and sprawling deserts, Earth is
                as diverse as it is extraordinary.

            </p>

            <p>
                Quick Facts About Earth
                Age: Approximately 4.54 billion years

                Diameter: 12,742 km (7,918 miles)

                Distance from the Sun: ~149.6 million km (93 million miles)

                Orbital Period: 365.25 days

                Natural Satellite: 1 (the Moon)

                Surface Composition: 71% water, 29% land

                Atmosphere: Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon, Carbon Dioxide, and trace gases
            </p>

            <p>

                Biosphere: The Web of Life
                Earth’s biosphere includes all living organisms and the ecosystems they inhabit. From deep-sea vents to
                tropical rainforests, the diversity of life on Earth is astounding:

                Biodiversity: Millions of species, many still undiscovered, co-exist in balanced ecosystems.

                Ecosystems: Forests, grasslands, deserts, and wetlands each play a role in global ecology.

                Interdependence: All living beings are connected through food chains, nutrient cycles, and mutual
                relationships.
            </p>

            <p>
                Formation and Structure
                Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from the solar nebula, the residual gas and dust left over from
                the Sun's formation. Over time, gravity pulled particles together, heating the planet and causing it to
                differentiate into layers:

                Crust: Earth's outer shell, comprising continents and ocean basins.

                Mantle: A thick, semi-solid layer rich in silicate rocks.

                Outer Core: A liquid layer composed mainly of iron and nickel.

                Inner Core: A dense, solid metallic sphere.

                These layers drive Earth's tectonic activity, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain
                formation.

            </p>
            <p>
                The Atmosphere: Earth's Protective Blanket
                The atmosphere plays a crucial role in sustaining life:

                Protection: Shields us from harmful solar radiation and meteoroids.

                Climate Regulation: Maintains Earth’s temperature via the greenhouse effect.

                Oxygen Supply: Supports respiration in animals and photosynthesis in plants.

                The five main layers (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere) support
                various life forms and weather systems. The ozone layer, found in the stratosphere, protects life by
                filtering out ultraviolet radiation.
            </p>

            <p>

                Oceans and Water Systems
                Covering about 71% of Earth’s surface, water is central to the planet’s life-support system:

                Oceans: Regulate temperature, drive weather patterns, and house a rich variety of life.

                Rivers and Lakes: Provide freshwater for drinking, agriculture, and industry.

                Water Cycle: Moves water through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and infiltration.

                Earth is often referred to as the “Blue Planet” because of the vast oceans that dominate its appearance
                from space.
