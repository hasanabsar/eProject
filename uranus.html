            <h1>Uranus: The Tilted Ice Giant</h1>

            <p>
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in our solar system. Known as the "Ice
                Giant", it is unique for its extreme axial tilt of 98 degrees — meaning it literally rolls along its
                orbit. With pale blue hues from methane gas, icy clouds, and faint rings, Uranus is one of the most
                fascinating and mysterious planets we’ve explored.
            </p>


            <p>

                Basic Facts About Uranus
                Distance from the Sun: ~2.87 billion km (1.78 billion miles)

                Orbital Period: 84 Earth years

                Diameter: 50,724 km (about 4 times Earth's)

                Mass: 8.68 × 10²⁵ kg (14.5 times Earth’s)

                Gravity: 8.69 m/s² (about 89% of Earth’s gravity)

                Rotation: Retrograde, ~17 hours (rotates east to west like Venus)

                Axial Tilt: ~98° (spins on its side!)

                Moons: 27 known moons (e.g. Titania, Oberon, Ariel, Umbriel, Miranda)

                Rings: 13 known faint rings

                Average Temperature: -224°C (−371°F) — coldest of all planets

                Atmosphere: Hydrogen, helium, methane (which gives it a blue color)

            </p>


            <p>

                Uranus formed about 4.5 billion years ago from the leftover gas and dust of the solar nebula. It is
                classified as an ice giant, meaning its interior is made mostly of icy materials like water, ammonia,
                and methane, unlike gas giants (like Jupiter) which are mostly hydrogen and helium.

                Scientists believe Uranus's unusual tilt may have been caused by a massive collision with an Earth-sized
                object during the early days of the solar system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Atmosphere and Weather
                Uranus’s atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with about 2% methane, which absorbs red
                light and reflects blue — giving Uranus its signature cyan color.

                The weather is extreme, with powerful winds reaching up to 900 km/h (560 mph), and seasonal changes that
                last over 20 Earth years due to its long orbit.

                Despite being farther from the Sun, Uranus is colder than Neptune. Scientists think this might be
                because Uranus does not generate much internal heat.

            </p>


            <p>
                Uranus has 27 known moons, named mostly after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five
                largest moons are:

                Titania (largest)

                Oberon

                Ariel

                Umbriel

                Miranda (has giant cliffs and scarps)

                Its 13 rings are narrow and faint — much darker and thinner compared to Saturn’s. They were first
                discovered in 1977.


            </p>

            <p> Exploration of Uranus
                So far, only one spacecraft has visited Uranus:

                Voyager 2 (NASA, 1986): Flew by Uranus and captured the first close-up images, discovered new moons and
                rings, and measured its tilted magnetic field.

                Since then, no spacecraft has visited Uranus again — but this may change soon.


                Studying Uranus is critical because:

                It represents a class of planets common in other solar systems

                Its extreme tilt challenges our understanding of planetary dynamics

                Its moons may hold subsurface oceans and potential for life

                It offers clues to the history of the solar system


                Uranus may be cold and distant, but it's a world full of surprises. From its bizarre sideways spin to
                its ghostly rings and frigid atmosphere, Uranus reminds us how diverse and strange our solar system
                really is. With future missions on the horizon, we may soon uncover the hidden secrets of this icy giant
                — and gain insights into how planets form and evolve in deep space.
