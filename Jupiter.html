            <h1>King of the Planets</h1>

            <p>
                When you look up at the night sky and see a bright, wandering star, there’s a good chance you’re looking
                at Jupiter, the giant of our solar system. With its massive storms, swirling clouds, and more than 90
                moons, Jupiter is not just the largest planet—it’s one of the most awe-inspiring.

                Let’s explore this gas giant in detail and uncover what makes Jupiter such a fascinating world.
            </p>

            <p>

                Quick Facts About Jupiter
                Diameter: ~139,820 km (about 11 times wider than Earth)

                Mass: Over 300 times the mass of Earth

                Moons: 95 confirmed (as of 2025), including the famous Galilean moons

                Orbital period: 11.86 Earth years

                Day length: About 10 hours (shortest day in the solar system)

                Composition: Primarily hydrogen and helium


            </p>

            <p>

                Jupiter is a gas giant, meaning it doesn't have a solid surface like Earth. It is mostly made up of
                hydrogen (90%) and helium (10%), similar to the Sun. Beneath its thick clouds lies a core that may be
                solid or made of dense, hot liquid, but this remains a topic of active research.

                Its atmosphere is a dynamic and colorful swirl of gases, featuring:

                Banded cloud layers: Alternating light and dark bands called zones and belts

                Jet streams: Extremely fast winds, up to 620 km/h (385 mph)

                Storm systems: The most famous being the Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth that’s been raging
                for centuries
            </p>



            <p>
                The Great Red Spot
                One of Jupiter’s most iconic features is the Great Red Spot—a massive anticyclonic storm system
                discovered in the 17th century. It’s big enough to engulf our entire planet and has lasted for over 350
                years. Recent observations suggest it may be shrinking, but it still remains one of the most powerful
                storms in the solar system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jupiter’s vast family of moons is like a mini solar system. The four largest—known as the Galilean
                moons, discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610—are especially noteworthy:

                Io – The most volcanically active body in the solar system, with hundreds of active volcanoes.

                Europa – Covered in ice, believed to have a subsurface ocean that might harbor life.

                Ganymede – The largest moon in the solar system; even bigger than Mercury.

                Callisto – Heavily cratered and ancient, with a possible underground ocean.

                These moons are so interesting that multiple space agencies have missions planned or underway to explore
                them.
