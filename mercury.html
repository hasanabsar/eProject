            <h1>The Mysterious Innermost Planet</h1>

            <p>
                When we gaze up at the night sky, our attention often drifts to the bright allure of Jupiter or the
                elegant rings of Saturn. But tucked away closest to the Sun is Mercury—a small, airless world that holds
                secrets about the earliest days of our Solar System. Despite being one of the least understood planets,
                Mercury has a fascinating story worth telling.
            </p>

                Quick Facts About Mercury
                Feature Detail
                Diameter ~4,880 km (3,032 miles)
                Distance from Sun ~58 million km (36 million miles)
                Length of a day 59 Earth days
                Length of a year 88 Earth days
                Atmosphere Very thin (exosphere)
                Moons None
                Surface temperature -173°C to 427°C
            </p>

            <p>

                Discovery and Observation
                Mercury has been known since ancient times, visible to the naked eye during twilight. The Romans named
                it after Mercury, the swift-footed messenger of the gods, due to its fast movement across the sky.

                Because it's so close to the Sun, Mercury is hard to observe from Earth. It never strays far from the
                horizon, making it visible only shortly after sunset or before sunrise.

            </p>

            <p>
                Surface and Geology
                Mercury’s surface resembles that of our Moon—heavily cratered, with vast plains and towering cliffs
                called scarps. These cliffs were likely formed as Mercury’s core cooled and contracted, causing the
                crust to wrinkle.

                Key features include:

                Caloris Basin: One of the largest impact craters in the Solar System.

                Inter-crater plains: Flat regions likely formed by ancient volcanic activity.

                Hollows: Bright, shallow depressions unique to Mercury, possibly formed by sublimation of volatile
                materials.

            </p>

            <p>
                Extreme Temperatures
                With no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury experiences some of the most extreme temperature swings in
                the Solar System:

                Daytime highs: Up to 427°C (800°F)

                Nighttime lows: Down to -173°C (-280°F)

                Its slow rotation (one day lasts 59 Earth days) contributes to these dramatic changes.


            </p>

                Magnetic Field and Core
                Surprisingly, Mercury has a magnetic field, albeit only about 1% as strong as Earth's. This was
                unexpected for such a small planet, but it suggests that Mercury has a partially liquid iron core.

                Mercury’s interior is believed to be:

                A large metallic core (about 85% of the planet's radius)

                A thin silicate mantle and crust
