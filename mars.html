            <h1>The Red Planet: Mars Exploration</h1>

            <p>
                Mars, also known as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun and Earth‚Äôs next-door neighbor in
                the solar system. Its reddish appearance is due to iron oxide (rust) that covers its surface. Mars has
                intrigued scientists for centuries and is one of the most studied celestial bodies in our solar system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mars formed around 4.6 billion years ago, along with the rest of the solar system, from a giant rotating
                disk of gas and dust. Through the process of accretion, particles clumped together forming larger
                bodies. Mars didn‚Äôt grow as large as Earth because it was farther from the center of the solar nebula
                and had less material to form from.
            </p>

                üåç Basic Facts about Mars
                Average Distance from Sun: ~227.9 million km (141.6 million miles)

                Orbital Period: 687 Earth days (1.88 Earth years)

                Diameter: 6,779 km (about half of Earth‚Äôs)

                Mass: 6.4171 √ó 10¬≤¬≥ kg (0.107 Earths)

                Gravity: 3.721 m/s¬≤ (about 38% of Earth's gravity)

                Moons: 2 (Phobos and Deimos)

                Atmosphere: Thin, mostly carbon dioxide (95%), with traces of nitrogen and argon
            </p>

                In 2021, Perseverance landed in the Jezero Crater with a goal of collecting soil samples and
                searching for microbial life. It also carried the Ingenuity helicopter, which performed the
                first controlled flight on another planet.

            <p>
                NASA, SpaceX, and other agencies are planning crewed missions to Mars possibly by the 2030s. The
                long-term vision includes:

                Sending astronauts

                Building sustainable habitats

                Producing fuel and water from Martian resources

                Possibly terraforming small parts for human survival
